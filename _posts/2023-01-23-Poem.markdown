These are the poems I wrote in 2023. Hope the readers find it entertaining.

**Note: If you do use the poems, please include the author in citation.

```
Oh! Oh! my sweet sunshine,
how my heart yearn to see your face,

the lips, the hips, the grace,
in the love of your ways,

call me if you miss the day,
we sailed acrossed the Hudson Bay,

rowing, like hands of clock,
through the trough and crest of waves,

reminds me of the time,
lying on floor, listening to your voice,

I pictured you in painting,
like that girl with pearl or ear-ring,

made my heart to open and sing,
like the nightangale or a rooster,

time and space may do us apart,
but your love will always be in my heart,
