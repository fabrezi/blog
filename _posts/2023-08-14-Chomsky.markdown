--------------------------

 You may agree with Noam Chomsky or disagree with him, but you can not ignore him. I have been influenced by the philosopher since high school days. He is the silent revolutionary. I don't know of any other intellectual, in modern times, to have impacted the world as Mr. Noam has done. An individual is judged by what he says and what he does. Mr. Chomsky has always done what he preaches. As being a scientist, he pursues all his topics with the same ferver, logical deductions and plethora of facts. As being an intellect, he has challanged the status quo. Noam is a hero that stood against the bullies and defended the public citizen. He wears no cape and has no super power. He is a man that uses his voice of reason with no constraints and his intellectual curiosity that is beyond bounds.

 As all great minds, they go through phases. In early days, Noam created a whole field in computational linguistics (which I still have to study further). Then in 70s, he became more active in political hemisphere. His writing on Vietnam War, Neoliberalism, Class Warfare, and public democracy  are considered classic works in social science and have become associated with Chomskyism (if the word can be used). Now, Chomsky acts as an arbiter or pamphleteer on global stage. He makes things simple to understand, promotes sensible policies and creates disctinction between good and bad actions. He is the Plato for the millennials. Its still too early to judge his work, but time will display the depth, influence and impact of what the professor accomplished. 
 
 Chomksy notion of three existential threats to humanity has become my world-view of the present state of our society. It states that there are three things that can destroy biological life on this planet: Global Warming, Nuclear Warfare and Neoliberal policies. Global warming or climate change has become a reality. The earths temparture is increasing, the weather is becoming unpredicatable, animals are becoming extinct at a faster rate and the sea level is on the rise. This year alone I can count dozen reports in which the climate change was having devastating consequences on humanity. For example: Canada and Hawaii wildfires, Arizona's 120 farenheit temperature, smoke and dust clouds in New York City and rain floods in the southern states. Scientist have been warning the Congress and government since 70s regarding the temperature rise due to fossil fuels usage [1]. But the political response has been slow and cumbersome to these issues. There are still climate change denialist which is a problem in itself.
