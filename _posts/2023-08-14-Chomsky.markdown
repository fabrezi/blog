--------------------------
You may agree with Noam Chomsky or disagree with him, but you can not ignore him. I have been influenced by the philosopher since high school days. He is the silent revolutionary. I don't know of any other intellectual, in modern times, to have impacted the world as Mr. Noam has done. An indiviual is judged by what he says and what he does. Mr. Chomsky has always done what he preaches. As being a scientist, he pursues all his topics with the same ferver, logical deductions and high- volume of data and facts. As being a intellect, he has challanged the status quo and stood with the masses. Noam is a hero that has stood against the bullies and defended the public citizen. He wears no cape and has no super power. He is a man that uses his voice of reason and his intellectual curiosity to make the world a better place. 

As all great minds, they go through phases. In early days, Noam created a whole field in computational linguistics (which I still have to study further). Then in 70s, he became more active in political hemisphere. His writing on Vietnam War, Neoliberalism, Class Warfare, and public democracy  are considred classic work in social science and have become associated with Chomskyism (if the word can be used). Now, Chomsky acts as an arbiter and warner on global stage. He makes things simple to understand for the public, promotes sensible policies and creates disctinction between good and bad actions. He is the Plato of the millennials. Its still too early to judge his work, but time will display the depth, influence and impact of what he accomplished.
