Title: Earring

```
Oh! Oh! my sweet sunshine,
how my heart yearn to see your face,

the lips, the hips, the grace,
in the love of your ways,

call me if you miss the day,
we sailed acrossed the Hudson Bay,

rowing, like hands of clock,
through the trough and crest of waves,

reminds me of the time,
lying on floor, listening to your voice,

I pictured you in painting,
like that girl with pearl or ear-ring,

made my heart to open and sing,
like the nightangale or a rooster,

time and space may do us apart,
but your love will always be in my heart,
```

Title: On Love

```
There were two lovers,
Mughal and Josephine,

He was made for her,
And she was sent for him,

They were one and the same,
Once breadth was another's air,

Jospehine beauty and grace,
Made the moon shy and pale,

Mughal courage and justice,
Made the sun into a burning furnace,

No one knows the secret of life,
But true lovers travel through space-time,

The stars danced to the music,
As the Lords made the acoustics,
```

Title: Ego

```
Life is a test,
To see who is best,

To think is to ressurect,
A past ceased in neglect,

Time is gold,
For those grown old,

Rivers flow, destiny bestowed,
What is it all? No one knows,

A man is clay of ego,
A mighty son of sorrow,

Hailed as a king,
Bequeath to a queen,

All she wants,
Is to be heard and seen,
```

Title: Ol Friends

```
As the train moves through time,
I see life as a blip in existence,

People faces appear and disappear,
Monuments stand tall then vanish,

I have coffee, bread and jam,
Spread on the wooden table,

I sip, I ponder, I gasped,
About times when  we chilled,

Talked about guns, cows, and girls,
Smoked till the eyes became blurred,
```

Title: Man all too man

```
Man all too man,
Man all too man,

The world is filled with humans,
None know the point of origin,

Man all too man,
Made of flesh and bones,

Cosmic dust that remains a float,
Like a speck of salt in stale water,

Man built roads, gadgets and gizmos,
Yet no one knows the steps of evolution,

We think we know but do we really think,
Never fear life, as life is a toil,

A toil game that is being and nothingness,
We gasp at the sight of the darkness,

Drawn into abyss like a moth into flames,
Man all too man,

The only test is to survive,
Use can, croony, spoons and every breadth,

To survive and see another daylight,
Time is fleeting, a flux in space-time,

Mind is to think, stomach to process shit,
legs to walk and soul to travel,

Society doesn't have no end,
So go on and do the best you can,

Man all too man,
Man all too man,
```
