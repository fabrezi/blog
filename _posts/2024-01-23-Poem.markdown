Title: Earring

```
Oh! Oh! my sweet sunshine,
How my heart yearn to see your face,

The lips, the hips, the grace,
In the love of your ways,

Call me if you miss the day,
We sailed acrossed the Hudson Bay,

Rowing, like hands of clock,
Through the trough and crest of waves,

Reminds me of the time,
Lying on floor, listening to your voice,

I pictured you in painting,
Like that girl with pearl earring,

Made my heart to open and sing,
Like the nightingale or a rooster,

Time and space may do us apart,
But your love will always be in my heart,
```

Title: On Love

```
There were two lovers,
Mughal and Josephine,

He was made for her,
And she was sent for him,

They were one and the same,
Once breadth was another's air,

Jospehine beauty and grace,
Made the moon shy and pale,

Mughal courage and justice,
Made the sun into a burning furnace,

No one knows the secret of life,
But true lovers travel through space-time,

The stars danced to the music,
As the Lords made the acoustics,
```

Title: Ego

```
Life is a test,
To see who is best,

To think is to ressurect,
A past ceased in neglect,

Time is gold,
For those grown old,

Rivers flow, destiny bestowed,
What is it all? No one knows,

A man is clay of ego,
A mighty son of sorrow,

Hailed as a king,
Bequeath to a queen,

All she wants,
Is to be heard and seen,
```

Title: Ol Friends

```
As the train moves through time,
I see life as a blip in existence,

People faces appear and disappear,
Monuments stand tall then vanish,

I have coffee, bread and jam,
Spread on the wooden table,

I sip, I ponder, I gasped,
About times when we chilled,

Talked about guns, cows, and girls,
Smoked till the eyes became blurred,
```

Title: Man all too man

```
Man all too man,
Man all too man,

The world is filled with humans,
None know the point of origin,

Man all too man,
Made of flesh and bones,

Cosmic dust that remains a float,
Like a speck of salt in stale water,

Man built roads, gadgets and gizmos,
Yet no one knows the steps of evolution,

We think we know but do we really think,
Never fear life, as life is a toil,

A toil game that is being and nothingness,
We gasp at the sight of the darkness,

Drawn into abyss like a moth into flames,
Man all too man,

The only test is to survive,
Use can, croony, spoons and every breadth,

To survive and see another daylight,
Time is fleeting, a flux in space-time,

Mind is to think, stomach to eat,
legs to walk and soul to travel,

Society doesn't have no end,
So go on and do the best you can,

Man all too man,
Man all too man,
```

Title: Hurt

```
Why it hurts,
When you love someone,

Why I dream,
When its not real,

Why I miss you,
When you dont know me,

Why I await for you,
When you never pass by me,

Why it hurts,
When you love someone,
```

Title: Loverboy

```
I will love you,
When it rains,

I will love you,
when it sunny,

I will love you,
When you happy,

I will love you,
When you sad,

I will make you pasta,
With snails and shashimi,

We will eat under a big tree,
Birds will sing accapella,

Dreams are woven,
In your hair curls,

Your body is a coke bottle,
Not fizzled, touched or seen,
```

Title: Pigeon

```
The pigeon walk through the meadow,
Seen, smelled, sniffed in the air,

By the wolves, the thieves, the trickster,
They came in compounds, for the final kill,

The pigeon, singed, flocked, pecked,
Then it turned around and check out all the fuss,

Pigeon head was on stick, the wolves ate the guts,
The thieves robbed the bird, and the trickster had an orgy,

Nature is to seek and destroy,
What be said of love and humanity,

A call, a sigh, a signal is send,
A tribe of falcons come to descend,

The evil will be served cold,
The good is on the march of gold,

The simorgh symbol is raised,
Here comes the eagle hand,

The wrteched and evil will hide,
The wings of death has come to rise,

The candle, the book, the ode,
Note to note the winds play joy,

The sun will rise from east,
The moon will die in the west,

Not one or the other chosen for best,
The pigeon makes for a good dineer flesh,
```

Title: Road Dogs

```
Its time for me to go,
To be back on the road,

Its time for us to depart,
You will always be in my heart,

Its been good, it was good,
Ten years we here and stood,

Your scent, shrubs and honeydew,
I will reminiscence and be blue,

So long the smoke,drink, and phuddi,
Don't act as if you knew me,

The hermit must travel on,
Into solemn, cold and ugly storm,
```
