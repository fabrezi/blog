Title: Pain

```
There is a pain in my heart,
That doesn't go far,

There is a pain in my heart,
That has left a bloody scar,

At time, I look at it,
To remind me of you,

Its old, withered and tattered,
Sometimes I wonder how you are,

Time to peel it, with a pocket-knife,
I see new skin, new hope, new life,
```

Title: Gimme Gimme

```
Gimme love,
Gimme colors,
Gimme life,

I will drape the sky,
With gloomy lights,

Scented candles and delights,
I will make the heaven filled,

With pool tables, cigars and bar fights,
I will kiss you all day, all night,

Gimme love,
Gimme colors,
Gimme life,

All treasures, assorted dresses and matching carpets,
Will be yours, all is yours, even me and I,
```

Title: Overcome

```
Overcome, overcome it all,
Overcome your addictions,

Alcohol, porn, gambling,
video-games, strippers and motorbikes,

Overcome, overcome it all,
It's nonetheless then to win a war,

It makes you believe in selfdom,
Gives you worth and a kingdom,

You will learn to fly,
Be the vizier of the sky,

Wind will sing your praises,
And men will bow their hats,

When the sacred touches the soul,
Then the noble heart becomes the goal,

You be on the way to seven valleys,
Where lies the temple of lords,

Have courage, have faith,
Spellbound the heaven gates,

Rise above the blackened cave,
Be ready to kiss her face,

Do not be contend with shadows,
You are man make out of ghettos,
```

Title: Journey

```
The journey is too long,
The journey is too hard,

Your heart be set on fire,
You will loose your mind,

Your bones will break,
Your will be crushed,

How can steps go back,
There is no path to back-track,

A young man must love,
There is nothing above,

You signed up for the ride,
Then why worry of full stride,

I will burn thousand skies,
Just to see her lovely smile,

The air is thin on the top,
The views is meant for a stop,
```

Title: Room

```
Bed soaked in sweat,
Eyes open to death,

Body lays in white cloth,
Body smells of chicken broth,

A pile of cigarette bids,
pills, napkins, a cup of water,

Lay aimlessly on the table,
A window open to the sunlight,

I can't tell if its bright,
My eyes and brain is fried,

The agony of delight,
The soul wants to fight,
```
