Title: Whale

```
Tragic deaths,
Magic beds,

Lying cats,
Smelly dogs,

Harpoon stalls,
Chaos falls,

Whale escapes,
Today ends,

```

Title:  Eyes Open


```
Life is the eye,
It is the eye in the storm,

You are holding to the edges,
With nooks, crane and pennies,

You are going to loose to many,
There is none left to empty,

Just look at me in the gust of shame,
The sheer armoa of disgust that transpires,

In the artic glazed donut of shisha,
The glass of sluts and brothels are assembled,

Left in the sun to be dried and roosted,
Like laces of pure golden carbon metals,

Heated in the angst, stress and anxiety,
Too late, too late it is already a bit late,
```

Title: Beach Girl

```
You won't remember me,
I will remember you,

The rose doesn't see the bee,
The bee must find the rose,

The beauty is in the eyes,
No grace, no taste, no scent,

Compares to her nascent fragrance,
As an ocean breeze on a summer's day,

Lay in the fresh warm sun,
Glowing, soaking, moaning,

```

Title: Pain

```
There is a pain in my heart,
That doesn't go far,

There is a pain in my heart,
That has left a bloody scar,

At time, I look at it,
To remind me of you,

Its old, withered and tattered,
Sometimes I wonder how you are,

Time to peel it, with a pocket-knife,
I see new skin, new hope, new life,
```

Title: Gimme Gimme

```
Gimme love,
Gimme colors,
Gimme life,

I will drape the sky,
With gloomy lights,

Scented candles and delights,
I will make the heaven filled,

With pool tables, cigars and bar fights,
I will kiss you all day, all night,

Gimme love,
Gimme colors,
Gimme life,

All treasures, assorted dresses and matching carpets,
Will be yours, all is yours, even me and I,
```

Title: Overcome

```
Overcome, overcome it all,
Overcome your addictions,

Alcohol, porn, gambling,
video-games, strippers and motorbikes,

Overcome, overcome it all,
It's nonetheless then to win a war,

It makes you believe in selfdom,
Gives you worth and a kingdom,

You will learn to fly,
Be the vizier of the sky,

Wind will sing your praises,
And men will bow their hats,

When the sacred touches the soul,
Then the noble heart becomes the goal,

You be on the way to seven valleys,
Where lies the temple of lords,

Have courage, have faith,
Spellbound the heaven gates,

Rise above the blackened cave,
Be ready to kiss her face,

Do not be contend with shadows,
You are man make out of ghettos,
```

Title: Journey

```
The journey is too long,
The journey is too hard,

Your heart be set on fire,
You will loose your mind,

Your bones will break,
Your will be crushed,

How can steps go back,
There is no path to back-track,

A young man must love,
There is nothing above,

You signed up for the ride,
Then why worry of full stride,

I will burn thousand skies,
Just to see her lovely smile,

The air is thin on the top,
The views is meant for a stop,
```
