Title: Pain

```
There is a pain in my heart,
That doesn't go far,

There is a pain in my heart,
That has left a bloody scar,

At time, I look at it,
To remind me of you,

Its old, withered and tattered,
Sometimes I wonder how you are,

Time to peel it, with a pocket-knife,
I see new skin, new hope, new life,
```
