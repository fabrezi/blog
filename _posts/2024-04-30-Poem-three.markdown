Anti-christ

```
I read Nietzsche,
As an addict,

He is the bird-person,
He burns in the sun,

Ozzy blazes on the speakers,    
There is no soul or helper,

The word on the street is,
Anti-christ is in the city,

I know the anti-christ,
He sits besides me,

Join my army, join my tribe,
He proclaims, vehemently,

I put out the cigar,
Punch the walls, break stuff,

I ain't you, bird-person,
I am not one of you,

Shaheen(Eagle) surrenders,
Only to the skies above,

Fly, hunt, fight,
Is the story of my life,

There is darkness in me,
It spills from the eye,

I blaze, I burn, I yearn,
Another day, another sun,

Fear is the master,
You must learn faster,

Face the hell,
Break the spell,
```

Title: First Step 

```
Men needs war,
Women needs men,

It is all the same,
JUst different names,

The road calls you,
No need for sad blues,

I fight to live,
Live to give,

Things happen,
No need to explain,

Take the ticket,
Watch the movie,

Naked bodies,
Rub in sheets,

Walk the red-line,
Places to wine and dine,

Stay awake,
Take amphetamines,

Watch the sun,
New day has begun,
