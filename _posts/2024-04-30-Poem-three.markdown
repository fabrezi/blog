Title: Anti-christ

```
I read Nietzsche,
As an addict,

He is the bird-person,
He burns in the sun,

Ozzy blazes on the speakers,    
There is no soul or helper,

The word on the street is,
Anti-christ is in the city,

I know the anti-christ,
He sits besides me,

Join my army, join my tribe,
He proclaims, vehemently,

I put out the cigar,
Punch the walls, break stuff,

I ain't you, bird-person,
I am not one of you,

Shaheen(Eagle) surrenders,
Only to the skies above,

Fly, hunt, fight,
Is the story of my life,

There is darkness in me,
It spills from the eye,

I blaze, I burn, I yearn,
Another day, another sun,

Fear is the master,
You must learn faster,

Face the hell,
Break the spell,
```

Title: First Step 

```
Men needs war,
Women needs men,

It is all the same,
Just different names,

The road calls you,
No need for sad blues,

I fight to live,
Live to give,

Things happen,
No need to explain,

Take the ticket,
Watch the movie,

Naked bodies,
Rub in sheets,

Walk the red-line,
Places to wine and dine,

Stay awake,
Take amphetamines,

Watch the sun,
New day has begun,
```

Title: On the go

```
Let it all go,
You already know,

There lies your happiness,
In the enchanted trees,

Be one with animals,
Read many books,

Understand history,
Speak different languages,

Be you, be original,
No need to be regional,

Love from heart,
From the start,

Command respect,
Don't ever forget,

That is the best,
A man with a test,

Shape the minds,
Break the spines,

Be rich, be sexy,
Always pay your taxes,
```

Title: Young King

```
Hey you, yea you, the young king,
Come with me to the bada bing,

Let me talk to you,
Hear this piece of advice,

First, relax and breathe,
See the gold under your feet,

Fill the mind with dreams,
Watch your critics scream,

Build a bigger brain,
Learn to play the game,

Start your day early,
Fulfill your duties,

Eat good, love hard,
Kiss your sweetheart,

Dreams come true,
When you play blues,

Hey you, yea you, the young king,
Just always remember one thing,

The eagle is the king the of skies,
As it only knows to hunt and fly,
```

Title: People

```
People are people,
Don't expect anything more,

They will hurt you,
They will ridicule you,

They be jealous of you,
They be cynical of you,

All in all just be you,
There is nothing else you can do,

Test out men,
To find a friend,

Work hard, speak truth,
Fight the bully and brute,

When you walk the path,
Don't let the nightingale distract,

```

Title: Ordinary Man

```
Take away my guitar,
take away my car,

Take away my glory,
Take away my booty,

But you can't take away metal,
From this old bunsen iron ore,

That burns, wrestles, jostles,
Toils, jabbed, stitched and bruced,

As the river meaning is to find the sea,
Then the warrior means to stand in battle,

Metal to metal,
Touch to touch,
Iron to iron,
Dust to dust,

The pull of attraction,
That makes the cupid cringe,
```

Title: Mexican girl

```
All it took was one look,
All it took was just one look,

Her eyes were deeper then black hole,
Her long black hair flew in the air,

I sat, wondered and thought,
Should I say hello or call her sweetheart,

She wore a grey top, tight black shorts,
Round golden eartops; sent shivers in my heart,

She caught me off-guard,
Gaze that pierced my soul,

All day, all night,
I dream of tacos,

Tacos floating in purple space,
Made of avocado, tortilla and cheese,

Her lips were soft and tender,
One kiss and I be spanish,

Mexican country girl,
Took away my quite nights,

I look at the stars and the moon,
Seeking her location and name,
```

Title: The Lost

```
Decisions, emotions, prescriptions,
All will be prescibed time after time,

But in the end how bad do you want it,
Do you want to straddle on the coast of life,

Do you want to see the golden ticket,
Taste freedom, gum, guns and google,

There are two roads in the forest,
There are two pills in the matrix,

One leads to the past,
The forgotten love, desert,

The other holds the future,
The intellect, gold mines and fast cars,

If you have burn the boat,
Then why worry for the sail,

Go into the wild,
Discover the governed,
```

Title: Loverboy II

```
Lost in the desert,
Thirsty, broke and dusty,

I am in the search of love,
To kill this old blue,

There is much to be said,
But I don't have time for you,

All be settled in dust and bones,
You won't remember me when I be gone,

My heart has gone back to black,
I can't remember the details or facts,

I have seen castles turn to dust,
I have seen metal gone to rust,

The sun will burn it all,
Cities, towns, houses will fall,

Rainbows will succumb to dark clouds,
Faces will turn from smile to frowns,

Your lover be a lost sinner,
She will end up as a stripper,

A dog looks for the bone,
I just want to get stoned,
```

Title: Broken

```
Wait, listen, hear me out,
I got no job, no royal titles,

I got no car, no home,
I got no dog, no tv,

All I have is a heart,
Real, hot, burning with love,

You can have it,
Just don't break it,

Its one and only,
I get quiet lonely,

My world is an ocean,
No beggining, no end,

Lover you should save me,
Kiss me and end my agony,
```

Title: Man Vs World

```
Make up your mind dear,
I am fighting for my life,

I sailed a thousand miles,
To see the past set in dust,

I am here standing tall,
Don't watch the sun fall,

There are lovers, thieves, devil,
I am just a man on the next level,

Life is nothing but a tragedy,
You don't need a grand strategy,

I am a sailor and a lover,
I don't want to be a heartbreaker,

Take my hand, 
Take my heart,

Thats is all I got,
It is all we got,

God makes two of kinds,
I wonder if your mine,
