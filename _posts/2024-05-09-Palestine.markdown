Faiz Ahmad (Pakistani poet) once wrote a poem on Palestine:

```
Don’t cry child,
your mother has only
just cried herself to sleep.

Don’t cry child,
just a while ago
your father took leave
of all his sorrows.

Don’t cry child,
your brother has gone
to another land chasing
after the butterflies of his dreams.

Don’t cry child,
your sister has married
and left for another country.

Don’t cry child,
in your courtyard
they bathed the dead sun,
and buried the moon,
before leaving.

Don’t cry child,
if you cry,
mother, father, sister, brother,
the moon and the sun, all
will make you sadder.

But maybe if you smile,
they will all return one day
in a different guise
to play with you.
```

This poem, sadly, is relevent during this time of Isreal-Palestine crisis. As I write this column, it is estimated that 35,000 Palestinian have died, which includes about 13,000 children. These children didn't even get a chance to weep or worry about little things. They were taken away from their loved ones for being on the wrong side of the border.
