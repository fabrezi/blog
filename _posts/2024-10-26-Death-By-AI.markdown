 AI stands for Artificial Intelligence. It is humans effort to create intelligence in electronic or silicon frameboards. It carries the name artificial as it is man made and is seperate from the creations of nature. Though the history of AI is thousand years old [1], the modern AI has it roots in 20th century. In 1956, a group of scientist (which included heavy weights in the field as Marvin Minksy, John McCarthy and Claude Shannon) who conceived a new field as "artificial Intelligence." There premise was to create thinking machines and discover the scientific basis of thought, mind and computation process of the brain. Earlier then the Darmouth meeting, was the collaborative work of Warren McCulloch (MIT Professor) and Walter Pitts, which set the basis of the neural network as we presently know of [2]. The MIT researchers were influenced by the ideas of Gottfried Leibniz, who stated that thoughts were an outcome of seperate components which were combined together to create concepts and facts and with the mixture of logical rules, all of human knowlegde can be produced. Further, McCulloch was a doctor by profession and saw the human brain as nothing different then a computing machine. As such all thoughts are computable. The neural network was an outcome of reverse-engineering the working of the brain neurons and synapses and the intriguing quality of neurons to be binary, as it sends or don't send an electrical signal.
