*Pakistan flag in my American apartment.*

 One day I was hanging out with my cousin. We were watching baseball, enjoying tacos and reminiscing the good ol' days. I remember he said a statement about Ameica that has lingered in my brain. If the American empire dissipated or becomes extinct (in future), it will be remembered for four things: US Constiution, baseball, jazz and bbq.  These are the best qualities that America has harnessed. It is the defining essence of the incumbent super-power. 

 I wonder what be makes Pakistan as a nation. What are the qualities that keeps the `land of the pure` or Pakistani as an amalgated body. For me, it's Imran Khan, The Northern Mountains, food and poetry. Before I delve into the aforementioned points, I wanted to talk about what is Pakistan? Pakistan is a new born country that came into existence in 1947. Its founder were highly educated, secular, professionals who saw the British empire crumbling and the Hindu superiority which wouldn't safeguard the interest of Muslim minority in India. Henceforth, came the proposal to create Pakistan. It won't be wrong to say, that Pakistan was a thank you gift by the Britishers (as Muslim League was the only Indian organization that supported British in World War 2) [1].
