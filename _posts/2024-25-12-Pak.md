*Pakistan flag in my American apartment.*

 One day I was hanging out with my cousin. We were watching baseball, enjoying tacos and reminiscing the good ol' days. I remember he said a statement about Ameica that has lingered in my brain. If the American empire dissipated or becomes extinct (in future), it will be remembered for four things: US Constiution, baseball, jazz and bbq.  These are the best qualities that America has harnessed. It is the defining essence of the incumbent super-power. 

 I wonder what be makes Pakistan as a nation. What are the qualities that keeps the `land of the pure` or Pakistani as an amalgated body. For me, it's Imran Khan, The Northern Mountains, food and poetry. I will now work to defend my aforementioned statement.
