Jhonny woke up with sweat and blood stains all over his bed sheets. He didn't know what happened. He couldn't remember the last night events. He didn't know nothing. He could smell cat piss, half-filled wine bottles and burnt carpet in his room. Nothing added up. Seemed as if a tornado went through his place. 

Jhonny got up. Took a caustic-yellow piss, made coffee and lit a fag in his balcony. He had his purple, rounded, crimmed shades on. He stared in the open shoes and looked through miles. He took a sip and inhaled, then let out a grey cloud in the open air. He tried to put his thoughts together as the clock hit 16:53. A feeling of sorrow, numbness, grief and tranqulity ran through his veins. He felt good. He felt safe.
