Jhonny woke up with sweat and blood stains all over his bed sheets. He didn't know what happened. He couldn't remember the last night events. He didn't know nothing. He could smell cat piss, half-filled wine bottles and burnt carpet in his room. Nothing added up. Seemed as if a tornado went through his place. 

Jhonny got up. Took a caustic-yellow piss, made coffee and lit a fag in his balcony. He had his purple, rounded, crimmed shades on. He stared in the open skies and looked through miles. He took a sip and inhaled, then let out a grey cloud in the open air. He tried to put his thoughts together as the clock hit 16:53. A feeling of sorrow, numbness, grief and tranqulity ran through his veins. He felt good. He felt safe. Everything seemed in its place but still nothing felt the same. 

He opened the fridge and found nothing but oat milk and an apple cider. Jhonny took a shower, shaved and put on denim blue jeans and a white shirt. He took a stroll in his neighbourhood. Sunny day with a decent wind. He stopped at a fruit shop and looked at all the items, fervently. Grapes, melons, watermelons, apples, pulp, apricots, sapodilla laid on the stall as a woman with her legs opened. Unitentionally inviting. He bought a bunch of the fuits, paid the amount and off he went on the unpaved streets.

On the way back to his apartment, he saw an old man. He stood in the middle of the street and was ranting loudly. Some people stared while others avoided eye contact. Jhonny was uncomfortable and curious at the same time. He gave an ear to the old man and heard him say: THERE IS NO GOD. THERE IS NO I. WE ARE ALL ONE. THERE IS NO GOD. The dude wore a black cloth. Old, filthy and rotten clothing. Dread for hair and not showered in years. Curly white beards with knots and purple dye on the left-side of the beard. He wore a strange conehead cap, with horns, drawing of stars and velvet sky. Jhonny felt being nice and offered an apple to the mystic. The Old man looked at Jhonny in the eyes, took the fruit and touched him on the forehead with his index and middle finger. Jhonny boy fell on the street and the fruits dropped from his hands like rubies on the dancefloor.
