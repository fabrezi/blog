## New Features

00. Create a new URL for the blog. I find the current URL long and cumbersome. It should be as follows: www.mowgliblog.com or something along the lines.

1. Email Configuration: This is a major feature. It is to formulate a method
to receive mail from a certain protocol which is independent of gmail domain.
Also I want it to use cmd prompt to send/receive messages.

2. Donate Button: This depends on the coffee emoji and setting.

3. Subscription: How can I make a subs method for the user to retrive
latest blog and reports.

4. Update the About section.
